# Xano Self Hosted Editions

## Enterprise - Self Hosted

This is the complete Xano application deployable within your own Kubernetes cluster with zero connection to the SaaS platform. This is for Enterprise customers needing complete isolation for their environment.

Please refer to our [Enterprise - Self Hosted](https://go.xano.co/enterprise-self-hosted) documentation for more details.

## Standalone POC - Self Hosted

This is a single docker image designed for quick deployment within custom infrastructure to rapidly prototype during a POC. It is common practice to migrate to  "Enterprise Edition - Self Hosted" upon a successful POC.

Please refer to our [Standalone POC - Self Hosted](https://go.xano.co/standalone-docs) documentation for more details.
